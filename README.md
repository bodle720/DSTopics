# Data Science Topics
This is a repository to store interesting applications of various data science topics. I go over some theory and showcase an application for each topic. Despite existing built-in implementations for many of these topics, the notebooks may use the 'long' approach in some cases for the sake of instruction. I hope you find it interesting!
