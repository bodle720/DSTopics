# Data Science Topics
This is a repository to store applications of various data science concepts. I go over some theory and showcase an application for each topic. Despite existing built-in implementations for many of these methods, the notebooks may use the 'long' approach in some cases for the sake of mathematical instruction. I hope you find it interesting!
